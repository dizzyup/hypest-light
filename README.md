# Hypest Light for Atom (β)

A light, native and refined UI theme for Atom — with optional vibrancy, and theming for several popular third-party Atom plugins. Also available in a [dark version](https://atom.io/themes/hypest-dark).

> Hypest is currently still in development and there may be rough, unstyled edges.
> More robust syntax theme support and bundled syntax themes are planned.

## Installation

You can install Hypest Light from within Atom or via the terminal. Once installed
select `Hypest Light` from the theme selection menu in Settings.

By default Hypest Light is optimized for light themes. If you wish to use a dark theme, for now you'll need to toggle the settings for 'Improve support for dark syntax themes'.

### From the terminal
